# Microsoft Supply Chain Center and Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management Providers

## Overview

This project is a collabaration with the community on providers for Microsoft Supply Chain Center and Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management.

Providers are a collection of Provider Schema, Connection References, Power Automates, Parameters and Power Query Transformations. These providers allow you to communicate with external systems to retrieve related data and transform it into a format that is understood by Dataverse.

## Sample Code

All contributions to this project, including those from the community and Microsoft are considered sample code. Sample code can vary in levels of production readiness, and it is up to the person or entity who uses these providers to deploy these to a test environment, modify them, and ensure their level of readiness before deploying these into a production system.
